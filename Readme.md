# ðŸŒˆ Magic Markup for Indesign

Define your markup in a simple a DSL and apply it to a text, in one click of a button (or a command with a keyboard shortcut).

## How to install

- Download `*.ccx` file from the dist folder
- Double click, install with Creative Cloud
- Profit

## Configuration

### Paragraph styles

```
# : Header
```

- Everything until `:` is part of the pattern, including spaces
- Last `:` on line counts as separator, so `::::: Weird` would match any line beginning with `::::`
- Paragraph style name is trimmed (unlike pattern), so it will be set to `Header`, not ` Header`
- **!** `raw` as a pattern isn't supported; see [Patterns: raw GREP](#patterns-raw-grep)

### Character styles

#### Symmetrical

```
__: Underlined
```

- Matches: `__This will be underlined__`
- Everything until `:` is part of the pattern, including spaces
- Character style name is trimmed when applied
- Is matched after Assymetrical character styles
- **!** `raw` as a pattern isn't supported; see [Patterns: raw GREP](#patterns-raw-grep)

#### Asymmetrical

```
_-:-_: Snake
```

- Would Match `_-Snakey snake-_`
- Both patterns - the beginning and the end - are accepted as they are (including spaces)
- Both patterns must have at least one character, but are greedy, so:
	- `:::: Woot` would parse as `[':', split, ':', split, 'Woot']`
	- `::::: Dumb Style` would parse as `['::', split, ':', split, 'Woot']`
	- `::: Double Colon` would not be matched (doesn't match `.+:.+:` pattern, that requires at least four characters)
- **!** `raw` as the opening pattern isn't supported; see [Patterns: raw GREP](#patterns-raw-grep)

### Patterns: raw GREP

All the patterns are escaped, so you may freely use any special GREP characters as a part of pattern without worrying. However, for the rare occasion you might want to use the full power of GREP in the patterns, you might prefix the line with `raw:`, and in that case you MUST escape any special GREP character.

One of rare useful examples (for an ordered list from markdown):

```
raw:\d+\. : List (Ordered)
```

### Replace Markers

You can turn on Marker replacement; within opening and/OR closing strings (at least one must be defined), you can enter either GREP shortcode or initials, and they will be replaced with the marker:

#### List of markers supporting replacement

Note: Examples use `[` and `]` as open and close strings respectively.

- Discretionary Hyphen: `[~-]` or `[dh]`
- Nonbreaking Hyphen: `[~~]` or `[nbh]`
- Flush Space: `[~f]` or `[fs]`
- Hair Space: `[~|]` or `[hs]`
- Forced Line Break: `[\n]` or `[flb]`
- Column Break: `[~M]` or `[cb]`
- Frame Break: `[~R]` or `[fb]`
- Page Break: `[~P]` or `[pb]`
- Tab: `[\t]` or `[tab]`
- Right Indent Tab: `[~y]` or `[rit]`
- Indent to Here: `[~i]` or `[ith]`

If you think another character/symbol/marker that isn't easily entered via keyboard might makes sense, let me know and I will add it.

## Known Issues

- _Very_ occasionally, scope fails to update; It usually happens when clicking _really, really fast_ between a story/textframe and a document. It's a timing issue between InDesign and the plugin and there's nothing to be done.
- Selection doesn't match the original selection with changes - less characters is selected; When the selection mode is selection (i.e. highlighted text inside a text frame or story), and the selection reaches the end of Story (or text column, or text frame â€“ unclear), InDesign occasionaly resolves the selection post-changes differently. I've mitigated the worst of non-matching selection before and after magic (e.g., when the first matched hyperlink was also the start of selection), but I can't find this one.
